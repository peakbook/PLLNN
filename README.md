Phase-Locked Loop Neural Networks
======
## What's this?

This is a demonstration program of Phase-Locked Loop Neural Networks.  
The network can memorize some patterns and recall them from an arbitrary pattern.   
Hebbian learning rule and Projection rule are implemented.   
You can try it on your browser.  

## Usage

Just try it!
